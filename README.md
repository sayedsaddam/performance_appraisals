# performance_appraisals
 This repository has been created for the project titled "Performance Appraisals" where employees will be evlauated by their supervisors.
	Besides the employees will also be able to review all the comments and thoughts given by their supervisors and forward it to the team lead where their three months performance will be evaluated and decision will be taken for them to extend their contracts.
	If the employees fulfills the requirements and complete their tasks in time, then they'll surely be given contract extension otherwise not.
	This system is basically created for such purpose.
	Suggestions and contributions are welcome.
	Besides, this is an open-source project, you can download and modify the code according to your requirements.
	-Contact me for further detail.
